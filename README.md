# Animal Crossing Turnip Check
!["Daisy Mae"](docs/turnip.jpg)
For any and all Animal Crossing fans-selling turnips can be very profitable. <br/>
This code scrapes the data from turnip.exchange to find the islands selling turnips at a price you select, a queue of less than 5 people and with no fees. <br/>
It will automatically open up tabs of the filtered islands to get you in that queue quicker. <br/>
All you have to do is <br/>
<b>Step 1: </b> Run npm install <br/>
<b>Step 2: </b> Run the command node index in your terminal anytime you want to sell your turnips. The price is autoset at 500, but if you are looking for something else, just add it to the end of the command node index (e.g. node index 600)
